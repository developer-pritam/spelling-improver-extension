# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

**Spelling Improver: Spell Better, Type Faster!** ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### Storage

We use Chrome's storage to save your settings, such as lock interval, difficulty level, and whether locks are paused. This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

### Alarms

We use Chrome's alarms API to schedule and manage the intervals at which the lockscreen appears. This ensures that the lockscreen is displayed at the user-defined intervals.

### Host Permissions

We request host permissions to allow the extension to run on all URLs. This is necessary to display the lockscreen overlay on any webpage you are browsing.

### Remote Code

We fetch a random word from a predefined list stored within the extension to display on the lockscreen. No external code is executed or fetched from remote servers.
